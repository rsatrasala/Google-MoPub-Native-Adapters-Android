Google Mobile Ads SDK - Android Mediation
=========================================
The Google Mobile Ads SDK is the latest generation in Google mobile advertising
featuring refined ad formats and streamlined APIs for access to mobile ad
networks and advertising solutions. The SDK enables mobile app developers to
maximize their monetization in native mobile apps.

This repository contains the source code for a sample project demonstrating how
an ad network can plug into AdMob Mediation. The project contains a
"Sample Ad Network" SDK library, as well as a sample mediation adapter
and custom event implementation for AdMob Mediation. The application uses the
Google Mobile Ads SDK to call into ad mediation adapter and custom event
to test the adapter's implementation.
